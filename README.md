This is the read.md file here I tell the idea

I make a password manager as a GUI in my laptop

problem : I cannot take my laptop everywhere If I lose my laptop I lose all data

Then I thought why not make a mobile app (I don't know how to but, I can learn It, yeah)

problem : Then i realised they will not be in sync, shit fuck

Ok, they only way to do it properly is to make a cloud stotage where I can store data, then access it via, web browsers, which, is available on both my laptop and phone, and That will work.

In future may be I can make a GUI and mobile app that is in sync with the cloud
